Introduction The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) establishes a general data protection law in Singapore that governs the collection, use and disclosure of individuals’ personal data by organisations. The Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) is established under the PDPA with the key functions of, amongst others, promoting the awareness of data protection in Singapore , and administering and enforcing the PDPA. 1.1 These advisory guidelines (these “Guidelines”) are issued by the Commission pursuant to section 49(1) of the PDPA to provide guidance on the manner in which the Commission will interpret the PDPA ’s provisions relating to its enforcement of the PDPA. Where relevant, reference is made to the provisions of the regulations issued under the PDPA, including the following: 1.1.1 Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2022-09-23T15:43:22+08:00', 'moddate': '2022-09-23T15:43:23+08:00', 'source': 'data_sources/Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of DP Provisions_1oct2022.pdf', 'total_pages': 52, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '3', 'chunk_method': 'smart_pdf_processor', 'char_count': 2007}, page_content='issued under the PDPA, including the following: 1.1.1 Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021 (the “PDP Regulations”); and 1.1.2 Personal Data Protection ( Enforcement) Regulations 2021 (the “Enforcement Regulations”). 1.2 These Guidelines are advisory in nature and are not legally binding on the Commission, or any other party. They do not modify or supplement in any way the legal effect and interpretation of any laws cited including, but not limited to, the PDPA and any subsidiary legislation (such as regulations and rules) issued under the PDPA. Accordingly, these Guidelines shall not be construed to limit or restrict the Commission’s administration and enforcement of the PDPA.

Overview of enforcement framework and approach The PDPA confers various powers on the Commission to enforce the PDPA. Broadly, these powers may be categorised as follows: 2.1.1 Powers relating to alternative dispute resolution These powers generally relate to the manner by which a complainant and an organisation may by directed by the Commission to resolve the complainant’s complaint, for example, through mediation or other mode s of dispute settlement. 2.1.2 Powers relating to reviews These powers enable the Commission to review an organisation’s reply to a request made by an individual under section 21 or 22 of the PDPA and to confirm the organisation’s reply or direct the organisat ion to take certain action in relation to the individual’s request. 2.1.3 Powers relating to investigations These powers enable the Commission to carry out investigations to determine whether an organisation or'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2022-09-23T15:43:22+08:00', 'moddate': '2022-09-23T15:43:23+08:00', 'source': 'data_sources/Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of DP Provisions_1oct2022.pdf', 'total_pages': 52, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '4', 'chunk_method': 'smart_pdf_processor', 'char_count': 2070}, page_content='powers enable the Commission to carry out investigations to determine whether an organisation or person is complying with the PDPA and to direct an organisation or person that is not complying to take the appropriate action to ensure its compliance, or to pay a financial penalty 2.1.4 Powers relating to voluntary undertakings These powers enable the Commission to accept a voluntary undertaking from an organisation or person including an undertaking to take specified action, where the organisation or person has not complied, is not complying or is likely not to comply with the PDPA. Further, if the organisation or person fails to comply with any undertaking, the Commission may give any direction to ensure compliance with that undertaking. Each of the above is discussed further in Parts II, III, IV and V respectively of these Guidelines. 2.2 In general, when considering whether, and how, to exercise its powers under the PDPA, the Commission’s approach takes into account two main'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2022-09-23T15:43:22+08:00', 'moddate': '2022-09-23T15:43:23+08:00', 'source': 'data_sources/Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of DP Provisions_1oct2022.pdf', 'total_pages': 52, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '4', 'chunk_method': 'smart_pdf_processor', 'char_count': 2070}, page_content='how, to exercise its powers under the PDPA, the Commission’s approach takes into account two main objectives.

From the organisation’s perspective, the PDPA requires or ganisations to develop and implement a process to receive and respond to complaints that may arise with respect to the application of the PDPA.3 Related to this, organisations may, as a good practice, wish to address complaints in an appropriate manner having regard to their customer'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2022-09-23T15:43:22+08:00', 'moddate': '2022-09-23T15:43:23+08:00', 'source': 'data_sources/Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of DP Provisions_1oct2022.pdf', 'total_pages': 52, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '5', 'chunk_method': 'smart_pdf_processor', 'char_count': 3147}, page_content='good practice, wish to address complaints in an appropriate manner having regard to their customer relationship management or public relations so as to facilitate the resolution of such complaints by the organisation concerned. 2.4 Where the Commission receives a complaint from an individual relating to a contravention, or pos sible contravention, the Commission will generally prefer to facilitate the resolution of the matters raised in the complaint or application between the individual and the organisation concerned instead of immediately exercising its powers of investigation under the PDPA. In this regard, the Commission believes that a mutually accepted resolution which addresses the concerns of the complainant would best meet the immediate interests of both the complainant and the organisation. 2.5 It should however be noted that the Commission is not empowered to award damages to a complainant 4. As such, the Commission will generally prefer to take other measures (such as'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2022-09-23T15:43:22+08:00', 'moddate': '2022-09-23T15:43:23+08:00', 'source': 'data_sources/Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of DP Provisions_1oct2022.pdf', 'total_pages': 52, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '5', 'chunk_method': 'smart_pdf_processor', 'char_count': 3147}, page_content='to a complainant 4. As such, the Commission will generally prefer to take other measures (such as facilitation and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms like mediation) to encourage the parties to discuss the issues in a complaint and find a mutually acceptable resolution, which may include compensation . For more information on the measures that the Commission may take when seeking to facilitate the resolution of a complaint, please refer to Part II of these Guidelines. 2.6 In relation to the second objective set out in paragraph 2.2 above, the Commission notes that there may be cases where many individuals may be affected by an organisation’s contravention. Even where only an individual or a few individuals are affected, a particular contravention may cause significant harm to the individual(s) or may warrant stronger action by the Commission.

The Commission may therefore conduct a review or an investigation in certain cases and, based on the outcome of the review or investigation, direct the organisation to take certain actions. For more information on reviews and investigations by the Commission, please refer to Parts III and IV respectively of these Guidelines. 2.8 For the avoidance of doubt, the two main objectives described in the preceding paragraphs are not intended to be mutually exclusive or to preclude the Commission from taking any actio n under the PDPA for other reasons .

Measures to facilitate resolution of a complaint 6.1 Where appropriate, t he Commission may, take any or all of the following measures when seeking to facilitate the resolution of a complaint. 6.1.1 Encouraging self-resolution The Commission encourages individuals who have a concern with an organisation’s conduct with respect to their personal data to first approach the organisation, clarify the reasons for the organisation’s conduct and seek an appropriate resolution of the matter. This is especially important in cases where an individual may be unclear as to an organisation’s data protection policies or specific aspects of the organisation’s collection, use or disclosure of his personal data. In such situations, the Commission notes that the individual would be best placed to clarify the matter with the organisation concerned.

For example, the mere fact that an individual has not consented to the use of his personal data by an organisation doe s not indicate that the organisation has breached the PDPA. This is because there are a number of situations where an organisation is permitted to use an individual’s personal data without his consent under the PDPA.12 In addition, where an organisation i s using an individual’s personal data in accordance with the PDPA and the individual would like the organisation to stop using his personal data, the individual will have to give reasonable notice to the organisation to withdraw his consent. The Commission cannot withdraw consent on behalf of the individual. 6.1.2 Referring a complaint to an organisation The Commission also encourages organisations to deal directly with a complainant’s concerns in an appropriate manner. Hence, another basic step that the Commission may take is to refer a complaint to the organisation (for example,'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2022-09-23T15:43:22+08:00', 'moddate': '2022-09-23T15:43:23+08:00', 'source': 'data_sources/Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of DP Provisions_1oct2022.pdf', 'total_pages': 52, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '9', 'chunk_method': 'smart_pdf_processor', 'char_count': 2528}, page_content='basic step that the Commission may take is to refer a complaint to the organisation (for example, through its data protection officer).
